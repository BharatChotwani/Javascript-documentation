## Browser environment, specs

- The JavaScript language was initially created for web browsers. Since then, it has evolved into a language with many uses and platforms.

- A platform may be a browser, or a web-server or another host, or even a “smart” coffee machine if it can run JavaScript. Each of these provides platform-specific functionality. The JavaScript specification calls that a host environment.
